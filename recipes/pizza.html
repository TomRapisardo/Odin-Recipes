    <h3>Margherita Pizza in a Skillet</h3>

    <p>Delicious Margherita pizza recipe loaded with melted fresh mozzarella, ripe tomatoes,</p>
    <p>and herbaceous basil leaves. Baking in a cast iron pan at a very high temperature ensures a crispy golden crust.</p>
    <br>
    <p>A fresh homemade pan pizza is always better tasting than ordering from delivery, and you can’t go wrong with a classic combo</p>
    <p>like a Margherita pizza. Using a cast iron skillet is similar to cooking with a pizza stone, as this material is excellent at retaining</p>
        <p>heat which helps to create a crunchy crust.</p>

    <h4>Ingredient List</h4>
        <ul>1 tablespoon olive oil, plus more for brushing</ul>
        <ul>1 pound pizza dough, store-bought or homemade</ul>
        <ul>½ cup tomato sauce, or pizza sauce</ul>
        <ul>4 ounces fresh mozzarella cheese, cut into 8 slices</ul>
        <ul>2 ripe tomatoes, cocktail, Campari, or Roma, about ten ¼" thick slices</ul>
        <ul>10 fresh basil leaves</ul>
        <ul>kosher salt, as needed for seasoning</ul>
        <ul>black pepper, as needed for seasoning</ul>
    
    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <l>Preheat the Oven – If using store-bought pizza dough, allow it to sit at room temperature for 30 to 45 minutes. Place the oven rack in the center position and preheat to 475ºF (246ºC).</l>
